## Project Title:

Random Quote Generator

## Project Description:

Create a web application that generates random quotes for users. The application should allow users to view and share quotes on social media platforms. The application should use a pre-built API like "quotes.rest" to fetch quotes.

## Project Requirements:

### Home Page:

The home page should contain a button that generates a random quote every time the user clicks on it.

### Quote Page:

On clicking on the quote from the home page, it should take the user to the Quote page where it should show the quote from the API, along with the author's name and a share button. Share via different social media platforms (the more you integrate the better)

### About Page:

The About page should provide information about the application and its purpose.

### Navigation Bar:

The application should have a navigation bar that allows users to navigate between different pages of the application.

### Styling:

The application should have a clean and user-friendly interface. The color scheme and typography should be consistent throughout the application. You can use CSS libraries like Bootstrap or Material UI to style the application.

### Authentication:

Use SSO from any of the third-party services (Google / Facebook) for this.

### API Integration:

The application should use a pre-built API like "quotes.rest" to fetch quotes. You can use the fetch() method or third-party libraries like Axios or jQuery to make API calls.

### Navigation:

Use React router for navigation between different pages.

### Deployment:

The application should be deployed on a hosting platform like Heroku or Netlify so that users can access it online.
